# MEAN-Calendar (work in progress...)
A simple restful Calendar app with AngularJS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

### Demo
To see and play with this app, follow:
[https://mean-calendar.herokuapp.com](https://mean-calendar.herokuapp.com).

It is uploaded in Heroku so it might take some time to load the first time. This should be fixed soon as I plan to upgrade my account.


*To instal and run this app, [this blog](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/) is very useful*
